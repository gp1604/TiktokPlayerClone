# Main Thread Blocking Fix Guide

## Problem Description

The warning "Main thread blocked by synchronous property query on not-yet-loaded property (IsEnabled) for HTTP(S) asset" occurs when:

1. **AVAsset properties are accessed on the main thread** before the asset is fully loaded
2. **AVPlayerItem is created synchronously** on the main thread
3. **Asset properties are queried** without proper async loading
4. **Network assets are accessed** without pre-loading

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue happens because:
- `AVAsset(url:)` creates an asset but doesn't load its properties
- Accessing properties like `.isReadable` on an unloaded asset blocks the main thread
- This is especially problematic for network-based assets (HTTP/HTTPS URLs)
- The blocking can cause UI freezes and poor user experience

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. AssetLoader Utility Class

Created a centralized utility for async asset loading:

```swift
class AssetLoader {
    static func loadAsset(from url: URL) async throws -> AVAsset {
        let asset = AVAsset(url: url)
        try await asset.load(.isReadable)
        return asset
    }
    
    static func createPlayerItem(from url: URL) async throws -> AVPlayerItem {
        let asset = try await loadAsset(from: url)
        return AVPlayerItem(asset: asset)
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent async asset loading across the app
- Prevents main thread blocking
- Reusable utility for all asset operations
- Proper error handling

### 2. Updated ThumbnailGenerator

**Before:**
```swift
let asset = AVAsset(url: url)
let assetImgGenerate = AVAssetImageGenerator(asset: asset)
```

**After:**
```swift
let asset = try await AssetLoader.loadAsset(from: url)
let assetImgGenerate = AVAssetImageGenerator(asset: asset)
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Asset properties are loaded asynchronously
- Main thread is never blocked
- Proper cancellation handling
- Better error management

### 3. Updated VideoPlayerManager

**Before:**
```swift
let playerItem = AVPlayerItem(url: videoURL)
let newPlayer = AVPlayer(playerItem: playerItem)
```

**After:**
```swift
let playerItem = try await AssetLoader.createPlayerItem(from: videoURL)
await MainActor.run {
    let newPlayer = AVPlayer(playerItem: playerItem)
    // ... setup observers
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Player item creation happens on background thread
- UI updates happen on main thread
- Proper async/await pattern
- Better cancellation support

## How This Fixes Both Issues

### VisionKit Warning Prevention
- ✅ Limits concurrent operations to prevent accumulation
- ✅ Proper cancellation when views disappear
- ✅ Lazy loading prevents all operations at once
- ✅ Global operation limiting

### Main Thread Blocking Prevention
- ✅ All asset loading happens on background threads
- ✅ Properties are loaded asynchronously before use
- ✅ UI updates are properly dispatched to main thread
- ✅ No synchronous property queries

## Best Practices for Asset Loading

### 1. Always Load Properties Asynchronously

```swift
// ❌ Bad - blocks main thread
let asset = AVAsset(url: url)
if asset.isReadable { ... }

// ✅ Good - async loading
let asset = try await AssetLoader.loadAsset(from: url)
```

### 2. Use Background Threads for Asset Creation

```swift
// ❌ Bad - on main thread
let playerItem = AVPlayerItem(url: url)

// ✅ Good - on background thread
let playerItem = try await AssetLoader.createPlayerItem(from: url)
```

### 3. Dispatch UI Updates to Main Thread

```swift
// ✅ Proper pattern
await MainActor.run {
    self.player = newPlayer
    self.setupObservers()
}
```

### 4. Handle Cancellation Properly

```swift
guard !Task.isCancelled else {
    await MainActor.run {
        completion(nil)
    }
    return
}
```

## Performance Benefits

### Before Fixes:
- Main thread blocking during asset loading
- UI freezes when scrolling through videos
- VisionKit warnings about too many requests
- Poor user experience

### After Fixes:
- Smooth scrolling without blocking
- No main thread warnings
- Controlled concurrent operations
- Better memory management
- Improved responsiveness

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Check Console Logs
- Should not see "Main thread blocked" warnings
- Should not see VisionKit warnings
- Should see smooth operation

### 2. Test Performance
- Scroll through videos quickly
- Navigate between different categories
- Background and foreground the app
- Monitor task count in debug overlay

### 3. Monitor Memory Usage
- Use Xcode Instruments
- Check for memory leaks
- Monitor CPU usage during video loading

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Preload Critical Assets

```swift
// Preload assets for better performance
Task {
    let asset = try await AssetLoader.loadAsset(from: url)
    // Asset is ready for immediate use
}
```

### 2. Implement Asset Caching

```swift
// Cache loaded assets to avoid reloading
private var assetCache: [URL: AVAsset] = [:]

func getCachedAsset(for url: URL) async throws -> AVAsset {
    if let cached = assetCache[url] {
        return cached
    }
    
    let asset = try await AssetLoader.loadAsset(from: url)
    assetCache[url] = asset
    return asset
}
```

### 3. Use Asset Preloading for Better UX

```swift
// Preload next video in background
func preloadNextVideo() {
    Task {
        _ = try await AssetLoader.createPlayerItem(from: nextVideoURL)
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

The implemented solutions provide:

- ✅ **No Main Thread Blocking**: All asset operations are async
- ✅ **No VisionKit Warnings**: Controlled concurrent operations
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Smooth scrolling and responsive UI
- ✅ **Proper Error Handling**: Graceful failure management
- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Proper cleanup and cancellation
- ✅ **Scalable Architecture**: Reusable utilities and patterns

These improvements follow iOS best practices for media handling and should resolve both the main thread blocking warnings and VisionKit processing queue issues.
