# VisionKit Warning Fix Guide

## Problem Description

The warning "There are more than 10 requests in the processing queue. VisionKit clients should cancel requests if the image is no longer present" typically occurs when:

1. **Too many async operations are running simultaneously**
2. **Tasks are not being properly cancelled when views disappear**
3. **Memory leaks from uncancelled async operations**
4. **System-level VisionKit usage accumulating requests**

## Root Cause Analysis

While this TikTok clone project doesn't directly use VisionKit, the warning can appear due to:

- **Thumbnail generation tasks** not being cancelled when views disappear
- **Video loading operations** accumulating without proper cleanup
- **Async operations** running in the background without cancellation
- **System components** using VisionKit internally

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Task Cancellation in VideoThumbnailView

**Before:**
```swift
.onDisappear {
    thumbnailTask?.cancel()
}
```

**After:**
```swift
@State private var isViewActive = false

.onAppear {
    isViewActive = true
    generateThumbnail()
}
.onDisappear {
    isViewActive = false
    thumbnailTask?.cancel()
    thumbnailTask = nil
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Added `isViewActive` state to track view lifecycle
- Multiple cancellation checks throughout async operations
- Proper cleanup of task references
- MainActor usage for UI updates

### 2. Improved VideoPlayerManager

**Before:**
```swift
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 15) { [weak self] in
    if self?.isLoading == true {
        self?.showError("Video loading timeout")
    }
}
```

**After:**
```swift
private var timeoutTask: Task<Void, Never>?
private var isActive = false

timeoutTask = Task {
    try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(15 * 1_000_000_000))
    
    await MainActor.run {
        if self.isLoading && self.isActive {
            self.showError("Video loading timeout")
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- Cancellable timeout tasks
- Active state tracking
- Proper cleanup in `onDisappear`
- Guard clauses to prevent operations on inactive managers

### 3. AsyncTaskManager Utility

Created a centralized task management system:

```swift
class AsyncTaskManager: ObservableObject {
    private var activeTasks: [String: Task<Void, Never>] = [:]
    
    func executeTask(id: String, operation: @escaping () async -> Void)
    func cancelTask(id: String)
    func cancelAllTasks()
    var activeTaskCount: Int
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Centralized task tracking
- Automatic cancellation of duplicate tasks
- Easy monitoring of active task count
- Thread-safe operations

### 4. Task Monitor for Debugging

Added a debugging utility to monitor active tasks:

```swift
class TaskMonitor: ObservableObject {
    @Published var activeTaskCount: Int = 0
    @Published var warningThreshold: Int = 10
    @Published var isWarningActive: Bool = false
}
```

**Features:**
- Real-time task count monitoring
- Visual warning when threshold is exceeded
- Debug-only display in the UI

## Best Practices for Preventing VisionKit Warnings

### 1. Always Cancel Tasks on View Disappear

```swift
.onDisappear {
    task?.cancel()
    task = nil
}
```

### 2. Use View Lifecycle Tracking

```swift
@State private var isViewActive = false

.onAppear { isViewActive = true }
.onDisappear { isViewActive = false }
```

### 3. Check Cancellation Status Frequently

```swift
guard !Task.isCancelled && isViewActive else { 
    await cleanupOnCancellation()
    return 
}
```

### 4. Use MainActor for UI Updates

```swift
@MainActor
private func updateUI() {
    // UI updates here
}
```

### 5. Implement Proper Cleanup

```swift
func cleanup() {
    isActive = false
    timeoutTask?.cancel()
    loadingTask?.cancel()
    // ... other cleanup
}
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Enable Task Monitor (Debug Only)

The task monitor is automatically enabled in debug builds and shows:
- Current active task count
- Warning when threshold (10) is exceeded
- Visual indicator in the bottom-right corner

### Check Console Logs

Look for these patterns in console logs:
- Task cancellation messages
- Memory warnings
- VisionKit-related warnings

### Performance Monitoring

Use Xcode's Instruments to monitor:
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Network requests
- Task creation/destruction

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Limit Concurrent Operations

```swift
// Use semaphores or task groups to limit concurrency
let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 3)
```

### 2. Implement Request Deduplication

```swift
// Cancel existing requests before starting new ones
cancelTask(id: "thumbnail-\(video.id)")
executeTask(id: "thumbnail-\(video.id)", operation: generateThumbnail)
```

### 3. Use Weak References

```swift
// Prevent retain cycles
weak var self = self
```

### 4. Implement Timeouts

```swift
// Always have timeouts for async operations
try await withTimeout(seconds: 5) {
    // async operation
}
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Build and run the app**
2. **Navigate quickly between videos** - should not accumulate tasks
3. **Check the task monitor** - should stay below 10 active tasks
4. **Monitor console logs** - should not see VisionKit warnings
5. **Test memory usage** - should remain stable

## Troubleshooting

If you still see VisionKit warnings:

1. **Check for third-party libraries** that might use VisionKit
2. **Monitor system-level operations** that could be using VisionKit
3. **Use Instruments** to profile the app and identify the source
4. **Check for memory leaks** in async operations
5. **Verify all tasks are being cancelled** properly

## Conclusion

The implemented solutions should significantly reduce or eliminate VisionKit warnings by:

- ✅ Properly cancelling async tasks when views disappear
- ✅ Tracking view lifecycle to prevent operations on inactive views
- ✅ Centralizing task management to prevent accumulation
- ✅ Providing debugging tools to monitor task count
- ✅ Implementing comprehensive cleanup procedures

These improvements follow iOS best practices for async operation management and should resolve the VisionKit processing queue warnings.
